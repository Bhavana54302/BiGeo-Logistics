"""To calculate how many boxes will fit into the Tata Ace truck, we first need to determine the total volume of the truck's loading space and the volume of a single box. Then, we'll estimate how many boxes can fit inside the truck.

### Step 1: Box Dimensions
Each box has dimensions of 16 inches by 16 inches.

- Volume of one box = \( 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4,096 \) cubic inches.

### Step 2: Tata Ace Truck Dimensions
- Length: 149.6 inches
- Width: 59.1 inches
- Height: 73.2 inches

- Volume of the truck's loading space = \( 149.6 \times 59.1 \times 73.2 = 645,355.27 \) cubic inches.

### Step 3: Fit Calculation
Now, we divide the volume of the truck by the volume of a single box to estimate how many boxes will fit:

\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Volume of truck}}{\text{Volume of one box}} = \frac{645,355.27}{4,096} \approx 157.56
\]

So, approximately 157 boxes can fit into the Tata Ace.

This is a theoretical estimate and may vary in practice due to the actual arrangement of boxes and other constraints like the shape of the truck's interior."""
