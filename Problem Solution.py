"""To determine the minimum number of trips and the distances covered by each truck, we need to incorporate the distances between the spokes and the hub into our calculation. Here’s how we can do it:
Initial Setup
Spoke Packet Counts
Spoke 1 (s1): 550 packets
Spoke 2 (s2): 710 packets
Spoke 3 (s3): 640 packets
Spoke 4 (s4): 430 packets
Spoke 5 (s5): 670 packets
Truck Capacities
Each truck (t1, t2, t3, t4, t5) can carry a maximum of 500 packets per trip.
Delivery Requirements
Deliver to:
s1: 500 packets
s2: 670 packets
s3: 700 packets
s4: 500 packets
s5: 550 packets
Transfers Required
Here’s the breakdown of packet transfers from one spoke to another:
From s1:
s1 to s2: 120 packets
s1 to s3: 200 packets
s1 to s4: 80 packets
s1 to s5: 150 packets
From s2:
s2 to s1: 150 packets
s2 to s3: 250 packets
s2 to s4: 200 packets
s2 to s5: 110 packets
From s3:
s3 to s1: 100 packets
s3 to s2: 300 packets
s3 to s4: 150 packets
s3 to s5: 90 packets
From s4:
s4 to s1: 50 packets
s4 to s2: 150 packets
s4 to s3: 100 packets
s4 to s5: 130 packets
From s5:
s5 to s1: 200 packets
s5 to s2: 250 packets
s5 to s3: 150 packets
s5 to s4: 70 packets
Transportation Plan
Step 1: Calculate Total Requirements
To meet the delivery requirements, we need to calculate how many trips each truck needs to make to fulfill the delivery needs.
Step 2: Determine Truck Trips
Each truck can carry up to 500 packets per trip. We will calculate how many trips each truck needs to make based on the transfers required.
Truck t1 (s1)
Outbound:
500 packets to the hub (can deliver 120 to s2, 200 to s3, 80 to s4, 150 to s5).
Return:
150 packets from s2
100 packets from s3
Total Trips:
1 trip to hub (to deliver 500 packets)
2 trips back (1 from s2, 1 from s3) = 3 trips
Truck t2 (s2)
Outbound:
500 packets to the hub (can deliver 150 to s1, 250 to s3, 200 to s4, 110 to s5).
Return:
120 packets from s1
Total Trips:
1 trip to hub (to deliver 500 packets)
1 trip back (from s1) = 2 trips
Truck t3 (s3)
Outbound:
500 packets to the hub (can deliver 100 to s1, 300 to s2, 150 to s4, 90 to s5).
Return:
No return needed.
Total Trips:
1 trip to hub (to deliver 500 packets)
No trips back = 1 trip
Truck t4 (s4)
Outbound:
500 packets to the hub (can deliver 50 to s1, 150 to s2, 100 to s3, 130 to s5).
Return:
No return needed.
Total Trips:
1 trip to hub (to deliver 500 packets)
No trips back = 1 trip
Truck t5 (s5)
Outbound:
500 packets to the hub (can deliver 200 to s1, 250 to s2, 150 to s3, 70 to s4).
Return:
No return needed.
Total Trips:
1 trip to hub (to deliver 500 packets)
No trips back = 1 trip
Total Trips Calculation
Truck t1: 3 trips
Truck t2: 2 trips
Truck t3: 1 trip
Truck t4: 1 trip
Truck t5: 1 trip
Total Number of Trips
Total Trips: 3 (t1) + 2 (t2) + 1 (t3) + 1 (t4) + 1 (t5) = 8 trips
Distances Covered
To calculate the distances covered by each truck, we need to consider both the outbound and inbound trips.
Distances Calculation
Truck t1 (s1):
Outbound: 250 km (s1-hub)
Return: 380 km (hub-s2) + 120 km (hub-s3) = 500 km
Total Distance: 250 km + 500 km = 750 km
Truck t2 (s2):
Outbound: 380 km (s2-hub)
Return: 250 km (hub-s3) + 200 km (hub-s4) + 170 km (hub-s5) = 720 km
Total Distance: 380 km + 720 km = 1100 km
Truck t3 (s3):
Outbound: 120 km (s3-hub)
Return: No return needed.
Total Distance: 120 km + 0 km = 120 km
Truck t4 (s4):
Outbound: 200 km (s4-hub)
Return: No return needed.
Total Distance: 200 km + 0 km = 200 km
Truck t5 (s5):
Outbound: 170 km (s5-hub)
Return: No return needed.
Total Distance: 170 km + 0 km = 170 km
Summary of Distances Covered
Truck t1: 750 km
Truck t2: 1100 km
Truck t3: 120 km
Truck t4: 200 km
Truck t5: 170 km
Conclusion
The solution involves making a total of 8 trips between the hub and the spokes to deliver all packets efficiently. Each truck travels with a maximum capacity of 500 packets per trip and covers specific distances based on their routes.
By calculating these distances, we ensure that we have an optimal solution that minimizes both packet delivery time and distance traveled by each truck.
Here is a Python code snippet that calculates these distances:"""
